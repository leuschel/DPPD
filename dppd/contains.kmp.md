The "contains.kmp" Benchmark
----------------------------

Part of the [DPPD Library](../dppd.html).

### General Description

This is exactly the same benchmark as the Lam & Kusalik
[contains](contains.lam.html) benchmark, except that the run-time query
is more challenging (in the sense that a Knuth-Morris-Pratt like
optimisation will pay off).

### The run-time queries

     :- contains([a,a,b],[a,a,a,a,c,a,a,c,a,b,a,a,a,a,a,b]).
